              An accountant posts an entry and a controller certifies the statements. An auditor signs an opinion and
              carries personal liability for it. In both cases a name goes on the work, and when the work is questioned
              — at close, in a review, by a regulator, in a court — that person has to show how each figure was arrived
              at and on what evidence.

              Most AI tools are built the other way around: they produce an answer and ask you to trust it. In almost
              every other industry that trade is worth making. In accounting and audit it is worthless, because a figure
              you cannot defend is not a figure at all.

              So we started from attribution rather than automation. Every piece of work George does — a drafted
              journal, a sampled population, a completed procedure — is authored, timestamped, evidenced and reversible.
              He prepares. You review. You sign. The record shows which of you did what, and it will still show it in
              three years when somebody asks.
